										<p class='description'>My group works at the interface of human genetics, medical sciences, archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics. Our main aim is to investigate and evaluate ancient human genome-wide data in the light of data from neighbouring disciplines to generate a detailed and comprehensive portrait of human prehistory over the last 20,000 years. Our portfolio ranges from global outlooks on population affinities, migrations and past demography to intra-group relationships, and also encompasses the interaction with and response to changing environmental factors, such as climate, diet and disease.</p>

											<p class='department'> Archaeolinguistic Research Group</p>
											<p class='description'>I use comparative linguistics to analyze the spread of ideas and material culture in prehistory by examining loanwords with reference to auxiliary data such as archaeology and genetics. My PhD project ‘Crops, Fruits, and Words’ researches this phenomenon in Central Asia, departing from Robert Spengler’s work on assembling the archaeobotanical data for the region. I particularly look at the interfaces between the various language groups, e.g. Iranian, Turkic, Burushaski, and Tocharian.</p>
