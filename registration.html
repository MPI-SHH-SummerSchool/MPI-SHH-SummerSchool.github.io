                                        <p>Our teachers are mainly doctoral students and will teach you theoretical knowledge about their field, the methods they use, and the soft skills they have developed. 
											The school will be held online from <b>August 16 to 27, 2021</b>. The first week will consist of lectures introducing the main aspects of archaeology, archaeogenetics, as well as linguistic and cultural evolution. 
											In the second week, the focus will be on case studies illustrating interdisciplinary projects that combine all three fields in a geographical area (e.g. Southeast Asia). Workshops on scientific methods (e.g., ZooMS, Bayesian phylogenetics) and soft-skill courses (e.g., LaTeX, graphics, research ethics) will be scheduled over the two weeks. 
											Each day will consist of 3-4 courses 9 am to 5 pm with breaks in between. There will be no parallel sessions so that you are able to attend all of the courses!</p>
										<p>Furthermore, you will hear three invited keynote talks from distinguished researchers and listen to a round table discussion between three senior scientists from our institute. The program is rounded off by social events in the evening where you can chat with fellow students, teachers, and the organizing team.
											To receive course credit for the summer school, you will need to prepare a poster on a topic of interest and present it at our poster session on the last day of school.</p>
